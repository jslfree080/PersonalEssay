#### Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
### People today are much better informed about international news than they were in the past.

#### (Modern people -> Spend most of their time at their offices, and smartphones and internet access force people to continue working even when people are at home -> Spend more time on their duties than ever before)

To begin with, people nowadays do not pay too much attention to <ins>international news</ins> because modern people spend more time on their duties than ever before. This is because people spend most of their time at their offices, and smartphones and internet access force people to continue working even when people are at home. In other words, people have no time to <ins>stay informed on global affairs</ins>. For example, my sister Katie works for a large investment banking firm. She is supposed to work from nine to six, but she actually works from eight to ten every day. She told me that she feels obligated to serve her company and to earn income for her household. Most her colleagues feel the same, so they contact each other by phone and the internet even during the weekends so that they can finish their work faster. Since everyone else at the company try their best to achieve their goals, my sister also makes every effort to fulfill her obligations even when she is not at work. Therefore, she has no time to spend on knowing about the <ins>world news</ins>.
