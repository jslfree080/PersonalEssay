#### Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
### People today are much better informed about international news than they were in the past.

#### (Modern people -> Spend most of their time at their offices, and smartphones and internet access force people to continue working even when people are at home -> Spend more time on their duties than ever before)

To begin with, people nowadays do not pay too much attention to international news because modern people spend more time on their duties than ever before. This is due to the fact that spending most of their time at their offices, with smartphones and internet access force people to continue working even when people are at home. In other words, people have no time to stay informed on global affairs.
