### When people succeed, it is entirely because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with their success. Discuss bought of this argument and give your opinion.

#### (Hard work -> Steadiness -> Success)

To begin with, hard work is always related to steadiness, and <ins>a stroke of luck</ins>, in constrast, <ins>is generally perceived to be</ins> a one time event. When we work at a steady pace <ins>over a long period of time</ins>, we are able to <ins>get ahead of the curve</ins>. Therefore, working hard is necessary to <ins>differentiate oneself from others</ins>. For example, my dad, a successful entrepreneur, is a compelling example of what I mean. Since 2001, he has <ins>run a very profitable technology firm</ins> which manufactures and sells <ins>a wide range of</ins> products. His business started very small when he invested his savings to develop and market a single product, and he <ins>spent day and night</ins> putting parts together because he <ins>was dedicated to changing the world</ins>. He never feared failures and managed to sell the product. When that product became popular, my dad <ins>compounded his success</ins> by introducing new products and <ins>gradually</ins> increasing the size of his company. His company later <ins>grew from a single employee to</ins> include a staff <ins>of dozens</ins>. All this was possible because he always tried to work hard. If his success had been merely luck, his success would never have lasted long until now.
